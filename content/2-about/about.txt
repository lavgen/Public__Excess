## Lal Avgen
Lal Avgen is an international artist completing her BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Having lived in Istanbul, Turkey before coming to Chicago, Avgen is shaped by the experience of living in two different parts of the world. Combining art, technology and performance, her work integrates the moving image with interactive sensors and code based art to explore these differences. Using language and the fallibility of translation, Avgen is interested in reversing the Western media bias by offering a view of that which is not widely known to its audience. Most recently, her performances have been shaped by destruction and acts of terror in Turkey and the lack of sufficient media coverage. Lal is currently a member of the international online contemporary media publication, Public Excess, which she also did the website for.  Avgen’s performances include; Elastic Arts Gallery(2015), Defibrillator Gallery(2016), No Nation Art Gallery(2016), Tom Robinson Gallery(2016), 4E Gallery(2016).

Their works have exhibited in groups shows at The Margulies Collection Warehouse, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, Oliver Arts Center at California College of the Arts and ThreeWalls@Rational Park, Chicago.

##Zeynab Ghandour
Zeynab Ghandour is an international artist from Beirut studying Art and Technology at The Art Institute of Chicago (BFA 2018). Ghandour works with 3D software as a post-photographic interface. The archive, or lack of, of their native country has challenged the individual and the collective history of Lebanon; a specific yet global symptom. Her work is focused on creating meta-narratives; the tension between the individual narrative and collective histories, familial relationships and material choices. She is influenced by nose jobs, reward systems, web-romance and contemporary cyborgs.
